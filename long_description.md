This application enables the transcription of the Petrie Museum's archive of pocket diaries kept by Lady Hilda Petrie. 
This one cover the years 1899 - 1900 and documents a fascinating life.


Images will be drawn from the Petrie Museum's Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. We would like help in 
assigning each daily entry in the diary its proper date and then with transcribing the often challenges handwriting for 
each entry.

This application should be a very straightforward and will contribute to an overall goal of transcribing the full set of 
 the Petrie's diaries. If you like this activity, we also have diary transcriptions for Flinders.
